# Transfer-Learning-Based-Classification-of-Poultry-Diseases-for-Enhanced-Health-Management
🐣 Poultry Disease Identifier A deep learning–based web application that identifies common poultry diseases such as Coccidiosis, Salmonella, Newcastle Disease, or Healthy from chicken feces images using a custom-trained model. The application is built using Streamlit and TensorFlow.

# 🚀 Features: 

🧠 Predicts poultry disease from uploaded fecal images ✅ Detects: Coccidiosis, Salmonella, Newcastle, Healthy 🎨 Beautiful dark-themed UI ⚡ Real-time predictions with confidence score 🐍 Built with TensorFlow, Streamlit, PIL, and NumPy 🛠️ Tech Stack Frontend/UI: Streamlit (custom HTML/CSS for styling) Model: .h5 file (pretrained Keras model) Backend: TensorFlow, Pillow, NumPy 📂 Project Structure
